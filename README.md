- **Missing Values**: Identifies columns with missing values and provides options to handle them.
- **Value Range Checks**: Ensures numerical columns like height and year completed are within plausible ranges.
  
Key Responsibilities:
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that the data is consistent, accurate, and usable before moving on to analysis.

### **6. `geographical_analysis.py`**
This module performs geographical analysis on the dataset. It focuses on mapping and plotting the distribution of the tallest buildings worldwide. Using tools like `matplotlib` and `geopandas`, this file generates visual insights about where the tallest buildings are concentrated across cities and countries.

Key Responsibilities:
- **Mapping**: Plots the geographical distribution of buildings on a world map.
- **Geographical Insights**: Extracts insights into how location influences building heights.

### **7. `predictive_model.py`**
This file contains the core predictive modeling functionality. It takes the cleaned dataset and applies machine learning models to predict building heights based on other features like number of floors, country, and year completed. 
- **Modeling**: Uses regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or other machine learning models to predict building heights.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R^2.

Key Responsibilities:
- **Predictive Modeling**: Trains and tests machine learning models to predict building heights.
- **Model Tuning**: Fine-tunes models for optimal performance.

### **8. `visualization.py`**
This module contains various functions for generating visualizations of the dataset. Using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`, it creates:
- **Bar Charts**: For comparing the number of buildings by country or city.
- **Line Graphs**: To track building heights over time.
- **Scatter Plots**: To show relationships between various building attributes (e.g., height vs. year completed).

Key Responsibilities:
- **Visualization Creation**: Generates plots and charts that help in visualizing the trends in the data.

### **9. `scrape.js`**
This JavaScript file was designed to scrape data from an external source (in this case, GDP data). It's used to extract economic information that could potentially be used in the analysis to correlate GDP with building heights.

Key Responsibilities:
- **Data Scraping**: Extracts relevant data from web pages to supplement the analysis, such as GDP information of different countries.

### **10. `Jupyter Notebook`**
The Jupyter Notebook serves as an interactive environment where all the data exploration, cleaning, validation, and visualizations are first tested before being coded into the respective Python files. It is a step-by-step guide to understand the data and perform preliminary analysis.

Key Responsibilities:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Interactively exploring the dataset and testing data cleaning and validation procedures.
- **Visualization**: Creating quick visualizations of the data to gain insights.

## How It All Works Together

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: The `main.py` file orchestrates the loading and cleaning of the data using the functions from `data_cleaning.py` and `data_validation.py`. The data is first cleaned and then validated for missing or erroneous values.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis & Statistical Analysis**: The `data_analysis.py` file conducts a thorough analysis to extract trends, summary statistics, and key insights from the data. 

- **Geographical Analysis**: Using `geographical_analysis.py`, the project visualizes the geographical spread of the tallest buildings, allowing us to see patterns in where the tallest buildings are located.

- **Visualization**: The `visualization.py` module is used throughout the project to create various charts and graphs, which help visualize the trends and patterns in the dataset.

- **Predictive Modeling**: In the `predictive_model.py` file, machine learning models are built to predict building heights based on historical data and other features. This is one of the more advanced parts of the project, as it incorporates supervised learning techniques.

### Data Validation
- **Data Consistency**: I gained a deep understanding of ensuring the consistency of data, especially in terms of validating numerical ranges and ensuring there are no incorrect values in the dataset.
  
- **Checking for Errors**: I learned how to systematically check for errors in the data, such as values that donâ€™t make sense (e.g., building heights that are too low or too high).

### Data Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This project allowed me to perform EDA using summary statistics and visualizations to uncover hidden insights and trends in the data.

### Geographical Analysis
- **Geospatial Data Visualization**: I had the opportunity to work with geographical data and create maps to visualize the locations of the tallest buildings, which helped me understand the geographical distribution patterns of such structures.

### Visualization
- **Effective Communication**: I learned how to use various types of charts to communicate findings effectively. Visualization tools like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` helped me transform raw data into clear and compelling visual insights.

### Reflection
- This project has been instrumental in honing my data science skills. Iâ€™ve gained practical experience in the full lifecycle of a data science project, from data wrangling to model building, and Iâ€™ve learned how to present data insights in meaningful ways. The project has helped me build a robust foundation for future data science work and apply machine learning to solve real-world problems.
